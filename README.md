# qnap-file-upload
Simple script to upload a file to Qnap share using a POST request via curl. Not a big dea, but since I did not imediatelly catch the idea on how to do this and some peaple expressed their interest, I will share it here.

## usage

```
 Usage: ./q-upload.sh [-f FILE] [-p PATH] [-f FILE]
   -h  Help. Display this message and quit.
   -f  Specify file to upload FILE.
   -p  Specify remote path PATH
 ```

 ## further information

Further information on the HTTP API can be found here. Maybe I will extend the features of the script to further functionality of this cgi script like creating a directore on the share.
